My name is Yash Mahajan and I am pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science and Application from Virginia Polytechnic and State University (Virginia Tech). I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with specialisation in Bioinformatics from Vellore Insititue of Technology (VIT) in the year 2019 and I felt that I needed some real research experience to know the nuances in the field of Social Network Analysis, which is where my research interest lies.   

Currently I am being advised by Dr. Jin Hee Cho (https://people.cs.vt.edu/~jicho/) at Virginia Tech and working on exploring different centrality metric in complex network and their implication on network resilience. I have been involved in different domains throughout my undergrad and grad life. I have experience and the necessary skills in Web Development and am very comfortable with JavaScript, AngularJS and nodeJS. 

Through the time and work invested in my internships and co-op, I have a strong grip over Keras and TensorFlow and have worked on devloping different machine learning models (for different communities) for predicting if a microfinance loan is going to default or not. During the course of my summer internship with Reliance Jio, I was also responsible for developing the chaincodes on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform using the Java SDK, as a PoC for Mobile Number Portability on Blockchain. 

My hunger for knowledge, determination to turn information into action and the will to bring about a change in this world has led me to bring about a small change in the Microfinance industry. As of 2020, I have published two conference papers on the use of technology in bringing about a change in the field of Microfinance and those papers have earned a lot of traction. 

I am really interested in working on challenging yet real problems and would love to collobrate with you if you have any interesting topic.  Please feel free to drop a message.
